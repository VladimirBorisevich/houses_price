The main goal is to build ML model with the lowest error for prediction house price.

## Dataset 
Dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes.

## Task 
Predict price for houses in test.csv

## Metric 
Root mean squared error is used to evaluate quality of machine learning model.
